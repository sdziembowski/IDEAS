The properties of DSA make it quite challenging to build a threshold version. In this paper, we present a threshold DSA scheme that is efficient and optimal. We also present a compelling application to use our scheme: securing Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin thefts are on the rise, and threshold DSA is necessary to secure Bitcoin wallets. Our scheme is the first general threshold DSA scheme that does not require an honest majority and is useful for securing Bitcoin wallets.",

In particular we exhibit a sublogic for which the upper bound postulated by Vardi holds.",
