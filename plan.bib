  abstract  = {Our motivation is the notion of ``timed-release crypto,'''' where the goal is to encrypt a message so that it can not be decrypted by anyone, not even the sender, until a pre-determined amount of time has passed. The goal is to ``send information into the future.'''' This problem was first discussed by Timothy May cite{May93}. What are the applications of ``timed-release crypto''''? Here are a few possibilities (some due to May): A bidder in an auction wants to seal his bid so that it can only be opened after the bidding period is closed. A homeowner wants to give his mortgage holder a series of encrypted mortgage payments. These might be encrypted digital cash with different decryption dates, so that one payment becomes decryptable (and thus usable by the bank) at the beginning of each successive month. An individual wants to encrypt his diaries so that they are only decryptable after fifty years. A key-escrow scheme can be based on timed-release crypto, so that the government can get the message keys, but only after a fixed period (say one year).  There are presumably many other applications. There are two natural approaches to implementing timed-release crypto: Use ``time-lock puzzles''''--computational problems that can not be solved without running a computer continuously for at least a certain amount of time. Use trusted agents who promise not to reveal certain information until a specified date. Using trusted agents has the obvious problem of ensuring that the agents are trustworthy; secret-sharing approaches can be used to alleviate this concern. Using time-lock puzzles has the problem that the CPU time required to solve a problem can depend on the amount and nature of the hardware used to solve the problem, as well as the parallelizability of the computational problem being solved. In this note we explore both approaches. (We note that Tim May has suggested an approach based on the use of trusted agents.)},
